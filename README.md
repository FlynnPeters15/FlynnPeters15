# Hi there 

My name is **Flynn Peters**. I graduated from the University of Illinois with a **Bachelor of Science in Finance**.  
I began my career in traditional finance and currently work at the **Chicago Mercantile Exchange** as a **Trade Investigator / Data Analyst**. In this role, I leverage data to detect market irregularities and potential rule violations, ensuring transparency and fairness in financial markets.  

I am particularly passionate about applying **data science** to solve practical, real-world problems. My interests lie at the intersection of finance, data, and technology—where rigorous analysis and innovative approaches can create meaningful impact.
